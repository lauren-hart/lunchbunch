# Lunch Bunch 

> EDA Pac. Hack

_We are Lunch Bunch NZ! We came 2nd place at the Auckland Pasifika Start Up Weekend with our idea to use technology to teach children and families nutrition education in a fun and engaging way through an app. Through the app children and parents can create healthy lunches while at the same time learning about nutrition in a fun way. Stress and guilt are then taken off parents as lunches are delivered to their child’s school._

_Those using the app will be able to use a link to share on social media for Fanau & those in the community who wish to contribute to children’s lunches. We are also aware of the many children who go to school without a lunch and we would like to give back as well. We believe that this is an old problem that needs to be solved in a new way using technology to empower children and families and to help them gain the nutrition education they need as well as to work together with family and others in the community to make it more affordable.
